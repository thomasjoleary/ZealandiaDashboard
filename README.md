This dashboard utilizes the library Leaflet for the map's interactivity and functionality. The tilesets used by the map are from OpenStreetMap.
This dashboard is coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Currently, the dashboard displays several hard-coded markers which fetch data from the repository's files. In the future, the dashboard should be connected to a persistent database and deployed to a website.
A prototype graph is below the dashboard, showing how quantitative data might be visualized in the future.
