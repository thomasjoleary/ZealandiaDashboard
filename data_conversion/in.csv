It is an important place for native fish species that must migrate between fresh and saltwater to complete their life cycles. Here, inanga (Galaxias maculatus)--a primary species of 'whitebait'--lay their eggs in low-hanging vegetation during a king tide. Restoring native vegetation along the estuary is therefore vital for enhancing the inanga population. Unfortunately, the estuary currently accumulates pollution, which is harmful to the species that rely on it.	assets/img/historicaldata/estuary/2025.png	O’Leary, T. (2025).
